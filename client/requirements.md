## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth animations for page transitions and interactive elements
date-fns | Formatting dates (e.g., "Posted 2 days ago")
clsx | Utility for conditional class names (often used with tailwind-merge)

## Notes
The backend is multi-tenant. The frontend assumes it's running under a specific domain or gets tenant info from /api/tenant.
We will use standard Shadcn components for UI elements.
Employer logos are expected to be provided via real uploads or tenant branding assets.
