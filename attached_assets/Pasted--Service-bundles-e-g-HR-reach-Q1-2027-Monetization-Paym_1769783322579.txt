Instead of wanderlust - your next job is closer than you think
Summary why the MVP is the right foundation
e The same user roles
e The same workflows
The MVP is already built with:
® The same core entities
® Compatible architecture for multi-portal expansion
®_ Clean integration pathways
Machine Translated by Google
This is exactly what a scalable, multi-region job portal platform requires.
® Content management and SEO points
®_ Flexibility for portal-level customization
The MVP is not a prototype; it is the technical nucleus for the full Greenland platform.

functional extensions ("Jobigo Basic").

solicited.
